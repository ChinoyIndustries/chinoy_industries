         <div class="textcontent">
            <p>Welcome to the homepage of Chinoy Industries Mfg. Co., specialty preservationists/restorers of early (1930s-50s) HO and American OO model railroad equipment. I'm Connor Chinoy, and this site is really just my personal homepage. This space is (or will be) home to several different, unrelated projects. This all originated with my old semester project from the <a href="https://www.greensburg.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh&mdash;Greensburg</a>'s <a href="https://newtfire.org/courses/upg-dh/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities</a> program, the <b><a href="http://woodbury.newtfire.org/index.html" target="_blank">Woodbury Clay Co. Project</a></b>. More recently, I decided I need some space online for other endeavors, and realized I could just put them here.</p>
	    <p>If you're wondering why it looks like the early 2000s in here even though it's a brand new website, that's because I'm writing the whole thing by hand. Design suggestions? Please tell me!</p>
