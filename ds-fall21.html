             <p>Homepage for projects from Fall '21 Digital Storytelling class at UPG. If you're here, you're either in my class or came to my main website for something unrelated and got lost. Honestly, I'm a bit surprised to see anyone actually here on my website, but come on in and have a seat. Stay a while, I'll make some coffee.</p>

         <h2><i>Where I'm From</i></h2>
         <div id="wherefromcontent"><p>I am from a toy train set,</br>
            Five hundred plastic and metal parts</br>
            All dismantled</br>
            I’m from the I-can’t-do-its and the hey-guess-whats</br>
            In roughly equal measure.</p>

            <p>I’m from the traffic light at the cornfield</br>
            pumpkin muffins and Victor records</br>
            From covered bridges</br>
            With old broken bottles underneath</br>
            And tiny frogs swimming among them</br>
            I raised them well.</p>

            <p>I am from getting tailgated by a Mercedes</br>
            Riding in the back of a ’93 Saturn</br>
            Because we are stuck behind</br>
            A quarry truck.</p>

            <p>I’m from the first good wineberries of the season</br>
            From the thorns</br>
            And the cries of birds overhead</br>
            because they wanted them too.</p>

            <p>I was once from Phoenix Books</br>
            And the path along the canal</br>
            Where the ducks come up to beg.</br>
            I’m from drastic measures</br>
            And will-you-be-mines</br>
            And Route 22.</p>

            <p>I am from “V. H. Burdorf: Meats”</br>
            And jars of buttons</br>
            From Shahnama and General Electric</br>
            From Varney, the Reading, and Delta</br>
            Out in the Grand Beater</br>
            To the city in the mountains</br>
            To the bricks in the valleys.</p>

            <p>I am from rust and dust</br>
            I am from glass and paper</br>
            I am the wandering Pennsylvanian</br>
            I am from everyone who used to be there*</p></div>
