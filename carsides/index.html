	    <p>For the past several years I've been working on digitally preserving a particular kind of content which does not seem to appear anywhere else on the internet: the vast variety of printed car sides commonly used in model railroad freight car kits in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. Over the decades, dozens of different manufacturers all across the US, in HO, OO, O, S and TT scales, used printed sides on as the basis for their rolling stock kits: boxcars, reefers, hoppers, and gondolas; the occasional heavyweight passenger cars; even tank cars, with printed wrappers to be applied onto a dowel rod or formed metal tube. While printed car sides largely died out with the advent of factory-lettered plastic model kits in the late 50s, some small manufacturers continue to print sides for boxcars, reefers and other cars on cardstock or scribed wood today.</p>
	    <p>Not only do car sides form an important part of model railroading's historical record, but the online availability of high-quality scans of various car sides allows modelers to re-print their own, whether they're restoring vintage rolling stock, or scratchbuilding their own cars based on classic artwork. Most normal modelers consider this style of model construction archaic, but it can have certain benefits to the experienced rolling stock builder, and it's still the method of choice for many "retro-modelers" who enjoy working with classic models from the early days of the hobby. (If you're here, you're probably one of them.) For as much as it's been an old standby of the HO modeling community for many years, hosting scanned copies of countless thousands of diagrams, instruction sheets, catalogs and ads from hundreds of model companies, <a href="https://hoseeker.net/" target="_blank">HOSeeker</a> does not include car sides, so I decided to host my own archive of them here. I found a Canon film scanner (CanoScan 5600F) at Goodwill, and so every time I come across any un-cut car sides, I've been scanning them in at 600DPI with the ultimate goal of making them available to you here! While car sides are traditionally printed on cardstock, I've also included scribed wood sides (Silver Streak), stamped metal sides (Athearn/Globe, Varney and others, most of which are not yet scanned in), and various related things like stock car placards, letterboards for passenger cars, and the occasional printed signs and scenery items. The main collection is HO scale; OO and other scales can be found on their own page.</p>

	    <p>Feel free to browse the collection and print what you need. (If you're like me and lack a color printer of your own, I recommend arranging what you need on a page and then having Staples or your local print shop print it on non-glossy heavy cardstock. It costs like $1 per page or something at Staples. Totally worth it!) If you build a model from sides you've printed from here, and post it to Facebook or somewhere, give me a shoutout! I'd love to see this work actually be used by other modelers out there in the world, and if you share a link to my page, it'll help other old-school modelers discover this resource!</p>
	    <p> If you have any un-used car sides in your collection, and would like to contribute to this page, send me an email! Most of my material is HO, so it would be great to have sides in other scales represented from other modelers. I'll happily accept scans in .PNG, .GIF or .TIF (please no JPGs because I am a quality purist and you can totally see the image compression if you print car sides from JPGs). Better yet, if you're not equipped to (or don't want to take the time to) scan them yourself, and you trust the USPS, you can send me car sides in the mail, and once I scan them in I'll send them right back to you, wrapped up as safely as can be! Email me if you'd like to do that, I'm happy to send cost of postage if it'll grow the collection of images. (Of course, if you have car sides you don't WANT, I would very gratefully give them a home. Willing to negotiate purchases of sides in bulk, as seems to occur especially with Red Ball sides.)<p>
